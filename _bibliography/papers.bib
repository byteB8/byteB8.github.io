  title={A computational analysis of flow dynamics and heat transfer in a wavy patterned channel using physics-informed neural networks},
  author={Roy, Aritra and Mukherjee, Ayan and Prasad, Balbir and Nayak, Ameeya Kumar},
  abstract={The current study utilizes an unsupervised physics-informed neural network (PINN) that leverages heuristic optimization techniques to solve steady-state incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes and energy equations in wavy channels for varying Reynolds numbers. Further, in asymmetric cases, in-phase and out-phase shifts between upper and lower channel walls are considered to mimic actual physiological structures occurring in many natural and industrial process. Moreover, the energy transfer equation is involved in the flow governing equation to accomplish the mixed convection flow for the fluid volume movement. Overall, the study demonstrates the capability of PINN (a more computationally feasible framework) for solving fluid dynamics and heat transfer problems and elucidating separation and reattachment flow dynamics in complex corrugated geometries.},

  title={Granite porosity prediction under varied thermal conditions using machine learning models},
  author={Dwivedi, Rishabh and Prasad, Balbir and Gautam, PK and Garg, Peeyush and Agarwal, Siddhartha and Singh, KH and Singh, TN},
  abstract={Porosity estimation at high granite temperatures is essential for numerous purposes, including natural and enhanced geothermal energy production. However, these methods of determining porosity have some disadvantages, such as being labor-intensive, requiring expensive instrumentation, and taking a significant amount of time, particularly during elevated temperature treatments. This study is vital for advancing geothermal energy applications by addressing the limitations of traditional porosity estimation methods. The study introduces innovative predictive machine learning (ML) models and offers insights into practical applications for improving geothermal reservoir management and sustainability.},
