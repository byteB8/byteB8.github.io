I am a Technical Project Assistant working on hyperpectral imaging applications in the mining industry. I have received my bachelor of technology in Mining engineering from [IIT(ISM)](https://iitism.ac.in/) Dhanbad.
I am broadly interested in developing and applying machine learning methods in various domains with particular emphasis in healthcare and education. Previously, I have interned at [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) on **Network Optimization** model for traffic and transit, advised by Professor [Tarun Rambha](http://civil.iisc.ac.in/~tarunr/). Additionally, I have worked as a software engineer intern at [Plaid Inc](https://plaid.co.jp/en/) working on development of intelligent bot.

I am always open to discussion and excited to exchange engineering and research perspective. If you are interested in collaborating or have any questions, feel free to reach out via email.
