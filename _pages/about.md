I am a Masters in AI student at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/). I have received my bachelor of technology in Mining engineering from [IIT(ISM)](https://www.iitism.ac.in/) Dhanbad. My interests are in Machine Learning, NLP, and Distributed Systems. Previously, I have interned at [cistup lab](https://cistup.iisc.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) on **Network Optimization** model for traffic and transit, advised by Professor [Tarun Rambha](http://civil.iisc.ac.in/~tarunr/). Additionally, I have worked as a software engineer intern at [Plaid Inc](https://plaid.co.jp/en/), where I designed and deployed AI powered (GPT-4) Slack bot using [bolt framework](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-js/). I worked part-time at [Mercor Inc.](https://mercor.com) as an AI Benchmarker. At [TEXMiN Innovation Hub](https://texmin.in/), I worked on a spectral-spatial transformer model with dense connections for hyperspectral image classification.
I am always open to discussion and excited to exchange engineering and research perspective. If you are interested in collaborating or have any questions, feel free to reach out via email.
